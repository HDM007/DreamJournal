        writing: "The dream starts right in the middle of a walk through the snow at night, on the edge of town. I can hear the wind whipping the trees, each breeze a howling wolf with a bite. I step through the snow, onto a dark hilly road surrounded by tall trees. Streetlamps illuminate each pocket of shadow ahead. The road extends into the horizon, seemingly forever. I begin to walk, for miles. Every few miles, the road melts away underfoot, giving way to a theater of memory and desire. On a cold walk, my mind wanders to my warmest thoughts, the passionate kindling of my wildest dreams - and the asphalt dissolves, replaced by the glimmering marble floors of Brookfield place, on the second level above the patisserie. Your shoulder brushes against mine. Our conversation fills the gaps in the crowd, leaving us in a world of our own imagination. We wander through metaphysics over dark roast and discuss our fears over fresh salads; we stumble along the banks of the Hudson while we make plans to stumble through the cafes of St. Germaine. I turn to you as you begin a joke- And I’m standing on a chilly doorstep in the middle of Winter, beard peppered with flakes of snow, scarf pulled up to my chin. The Christmas lights on the railings cast a sparkle on the icicles. The host opens the door, and I walk into a room full of strangers, who all welcome me to the party. Laughter. Smiles. Kindness. Warmth. I don’t recall how much time passes, but it’s nice for a while. I sit by a big window and have a strong drink in front of the fire - but inevitably, my eyes are always drawn back to the road, where I might find you once again."
